#CaterSquad - Company Catering Made Easy
---

CaterSquad was a corporate caterer that connected restaurants, snack and drink producers with companies wanting to provide meals to their employees. This project was built through the European Innovation Academy, a 3-week accelerator focused on IT innovations. Our team placed 2 out of 10 in our respective cohort's final pitch competition.

We made deals with the likes of Vita Coco to package their drinks with every meal - free of charge and were able to attract teams from PWC and Accenture for a paid trial.
